  slideSelector: ".slide", // This option will let you assign custom selector for each slides in case .slide is already taken
  container: ".main", // This option lets you define the container of which the background will appear. Make sure the slider is inside this container as well.
  cssBlur: false, // Experimental: In case you don't want to keep adding new data-blurred attributes, trigger this to true and it will generate the blur image on the fly (more info below).
  pagination: true, // Toggle this to false if you don't want a pagination
  loop: true, // Toggle to false if you don't want the slider to loop. Default is true.
  autoStart: 5000 // Define the number of milliseconds before it navigates automatically. Change this to 0 or false to disable autoStart. The default value is 5000.
